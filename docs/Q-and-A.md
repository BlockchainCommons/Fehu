# Q&A section General

## *Q: What is GordianGuardian?
A seed management tool

<img src="../images/xxxx.png" alt="xxxx" border="0" width="600">

## For who is GordianGuardian?

## WHy should I use GordianGuardian?

## When should I use GordianGuardian?

# Q&A section GordianGuardian operational

## *Q: On what platform or devices does GordianGuardian run?
March 2021: Currently only iOS Testflight, alpha release.

## I get confused by a *seed request* on one device. Could explain more?
- [x] github [issue 40](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianGuardian-iOS/issues/40)

üê∫ I'm not sure how to make this clearer. Typically "another device" **will note** be this device. If the requested seed is not already on the device, it obviously can't send it, and will tell you so. It also makes clear the consequences of sending the seed (via the QR Code) to another device.\
The request URs available [in the test PDFs](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianGuardian-iOS/tree/master/Testing) are so, you can test a UR similar to what another device would show when requesting a seed from this device.

# Q&A Schemes

## **Q: Is SSKR a rebrand of SSSS, Shamir Secret Sharing scheme?
- [x] github [issue 37](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianGuardian-iOS/issues/37)
üê∫ Under the hood SSKR is using the technique of Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) but SSKR is a particular packaging of that technique optimized for `CBOR` and `UR`s.

# Q&A Security

## *Q: I can import the same seed twice
*I can't think of a reason why I would want to import the same seed twice.*
- [x] github [issue 41](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianGuardian-iOS/issues/41)

üê∫ `ur:crypto-seed` contains metadata like name and notes that can be different. It's up to the user to reconcile these differences.

## *Q: Why it is recommended to delete all data from the device before deleting the app?
üê∫ {TBW1}

## *Q: I swiped to delete a seed, now the settings cog asks me to delete ALL seeds??
*If as a user 'I don't know that I have to right-left swipe' to delete a rendundant seed, then clicking on the seed and as natural flow, I choose the cog, I might go forward and delete everything, instead of trying to get rid of just one seed.*
- [x] github [issue 42](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianGuardian-iOS/issues/42)

| Swipe left | Click on |

üê∫ **You don't have to swipe on a seed to delete it**. Just tap the Edit button and then tap one of the Delete buttons that appear. This is iOS-standard behavior. Swipe-to-delete is a shortcut. Later when we have more settings the "Danger Zone" box will get pushed down further. 
> The warning message has been clarified to: "All data will be erased from the app, including ALL seeds stored in the device keychain. This is recommended before deleting the app from your device, because deleting an app does not guarantee deletion of all data added to the keychain by that app."

## *Q: Copy paste of a BIP39 seed is a good idea?
There are security issues related to copy-pasting when your computer has been compromised. On the other hand it's easy and less error prone to copy and paste. It's your choice. You can also type in the 24 word seed.
